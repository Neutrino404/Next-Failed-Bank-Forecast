#In this notebook, I attempt to predict the next bank failure using historic financial ratios for all U.S. banks in the FDIC database. The target labels are binary, with a positive instance indicating that the bank will fail within a given time frame. I have specifically chosen the failure within 180 days to optimize for the fact that the FDIC releases the quarterly bank call report data with a lag of about 60 to 90 days after the end of the quarter. Also, this label seemed to give the best results. I also prioritized precision over recall, as shown in the confusion matrix below for the best model. The hyperparameters were selected via HyperOpt in another private notebook and are used below. Also, the results for different sets of hyperparameters are also recorded below. Financial ratios dataset is of shape (656438, 796) with 796 features and 656438 training examples for the past 90 quarters (see dataset page for more information). The best model achieved the following results on the test set: AUC=0.636, F1=0.413, Precision=0.83
