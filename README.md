# Next-Failed-Bank-Forecast
Forecasting the next bank failures with machine learning using data from FDIC public bank data.

Using public bank data provided by the FDIC, consisting of the failed bank list as well as the financial quarterly ratios for all U.S. banks, which are cleaned and hosted on Kaggle, this project aims to forecast the next bank failures. Being able to identify troubled banks ahead of time will help increase public awareness.

Using various machine learning models and architectures in order to achieve a better F1 score with each successive model. This is a public project, so feel free to contribute.

The datasets on Kaggle are maintained and updated every quarter by me.
